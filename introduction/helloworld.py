#Here is a sample line of code that can be executed in Python:

#print("Hello, World!")
#You can just as easily store a string as a variable and then print it to stdout:

#my_string = "Hello, World!"
#print(my_string)
#The above code will print Hello, World! on your screen. Try it yourself in the editor below!

def print_hi(my_string):
    # Use a breakpoint in the code line below to debug your script.
    print(my_string)  # Press Ctrl+F8 to toggle the breakpoint.


# Press the green button in the gutter to run the script.
